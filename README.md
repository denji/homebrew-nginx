# Nginx Homebrew Tap

This tap is designed specifically for custom builds of Nginx with added modules.

## Installation

    brew tap marcqualie/nginx

## Why submit modules here?

Rather than submitting modules to the core Homebrew Nginx Forumla this repo will serve as a place where any module can be added and configured for custom purposes.

## What about conflicts?

I've named the formulae in this tap differently so you can easily have multiple versions of Nginx installed side by side.

## Credits

Credit for the original base forumla comes from https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/nginx.rb and I will keep this formula up to date with any changes made there.
