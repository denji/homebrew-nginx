# NGINX Homebrew Tap

This tap is designed specifically for a custom build of NGINX with more module options.

## How do I install these formule (NGINX Modules)?
Once the tap is installed, you can install `nginx-full`
with optional [additional modules](https://brew.sh/homebrew-nginx/#modules):

    brew tap homebrew/nginx
    brew install nginx-full --with-upload-module

For a list of available configuration options run:

    brew options nginx-full
    brew info nginx-full

## What about conflicts?
You are free to install this version alongside a current install of NGINX from `Homebrew/homebrew` if you wish. However, they cannot be linked at the same time. To switch between them use brew's built in linking system.

    brew unlink nginx
    brew link nginx-full
